# HQ Assist
HQ Assist is a HQ Trivia Discord bot that connects to the HQ servers and provides information on user and game data for all regions. Because it is from 2018, it is now outdated. Uses discord.py for connection to Discord.

## General Notes
* As this bot is from 2018, there are a few issues with compatability.
* Lack of support for new game modes.
* Code is sloppy and not modulised. This is especially noticable with the convoluted timezone conversions.
* Bearer tokens are not provided and will need to be added manually.
